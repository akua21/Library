Demo of the creation of a series of data structures using *Python*

The structures are: **stack**, **queue**, **ordered queue** and **tree**

Each data structure has its own .py with specific functions such as: create object, add object or see all objects

These objects have value and priority as attributes

The *main* file is where you can create the structure that you want using its functions, it also has prints to see it
